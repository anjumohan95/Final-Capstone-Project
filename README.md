# Final-Capstone-Project
Doc Assist - final capstone project- upGrad

## Introduction
This project involves building a classification model using the Random Forest algorithm. The project includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The model is then saved for future use.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and standardization using `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `scipy`.
- Visualization of data and results using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning with `Scikit-learn`.
- Saving the trained model for future use with `joblib`.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `NumPy`: Numerical computations
  - `Matplotlib`: Data visualization
  - `Seaborn`: Statistical data visualization
  - `Scipy`: Scientific computing
  - `Scikit-learn`: Machine learning and model evaluation
  - `joblib`: Model persistence
